I created a app that helps users create and manage their music playlists and rate them with allowance to comment on each song


App Features:
Add Songs – Input and save song title, artist, rating, and comment.
Validation – Checks all fields and rating range (1-5) before saving.
Limit – Only allows a maximum of 4 songs in the playlist.
Two Screens – Main screen for input, second screen for playlist details.
View Playlist – Shows all songs and their details using a loop.
Average Rating – Calculates and displays average song rating.
Navigation & Exit – Buttons to go back, continue adding, or exit the app.

Git Commands:
git init
git add.
git commit -m "First Commit"
git remote add origin <repository_link>
git push origin main
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main When you're done with the commands you've now have submitted on GitHub
